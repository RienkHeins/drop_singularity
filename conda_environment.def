    This is a build container for a sif file for the detection of RNA outliers pipeline (DROP) which can be accessed by
    using 'singularity shell drop_test.sif'. To activate the DROP environment run 'conda activate drop_env' while in the
    singularity container. For further instructions about the pipeline read the README found in the drop_env.
